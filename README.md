# Predicting-Medical-Costs-Using-MLR
This is a basic machine learning algorithm in R. Medical costs are related to various demographics. After applying a standard linear regression, I improve upon the model by creating interaction variables, nonlinear variables, and an additional dummy variable. 

The data comes from a Kaggle data set found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance. 

The data contains the following variables: 

age: age of primary beneficiary

sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male

bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

smoker: Smoking

region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance
